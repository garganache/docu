You can also see the definition of the task and you can navigate to the instance it is related to.

The display is either a list or a card view. You can see the status of each task that was ran as well as the session that was generated by the task.
A task is successful if it starts and finishes. The task status does not depend on the status of the execution of the session.

A task can be in failed state if the instance gets deleted and the task should run it.
