Scope & definitions
####################

This documentation section is dedicated to the user interface procedures,
which means it is deemed most relevant for user that will work in Yields for Performance without bothering too much on how the underlying
notebooks themselves are working.

Users intending to create/work with the notebooks themselves are referred to :ref:`library_docs`.

We assume that the definitions of the objects used are known to the user, otherwise we refer him to the :ref:`glossary`.
