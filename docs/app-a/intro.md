# Yields for Performance

**Scalable Data Science Platform for Model Risk Management**

Yields for Performance is Yield's scalable data science platform for Model Risk Management (MRM). It distinguishes itself from other data science environments because it has been designed with the main purpose of standardizing model risk management.

## Key Capabilities

- **Reproducibility**: ensuring that historically obtained results can be reproduced at all times.
- **Auditability**: creating and maintaining the relevant metadata on all the algorithm's related objects (i.e. input, output, the algorithm itself and their mutual relations, i.e. lineage)
- **Standardization**: enabling efficient use of code by means of having 'specification templates'.
- **Sharing** data and computations to enable efficient interactions between teams.

## Available Versions

- **[v2.13](v1.0/intro)** (Latest, Stable) - Current production release
