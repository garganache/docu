# Getting Started

## End-to-end example: basics on how to work with Yields for Performance

In this section we enable the user to start using Yields for Performance by providing a particular use case, including the relevant datasets, Jupyter notebook, readme etc. The main goal is to offer some specific end-to-end use cases such that the user gets familiar with all steps to be taken in creating their own model risk assessments in Yields for Performance.

In this example you will learn the most basic workflow within Yields for Performance, i.e. reading in a dataset, doing some calculations on it, and saving another dataset containing those metrics back into the artifact store.

This example teaches you:

- How to create (and run) an [Artifact](../concepts/glossary.md#artifact), a [Specification](../concepts/glossary.md#specification) and an [Instance](../concepts/glossary.md#instance).

In a separate chapter we deliver other examples that can be considered practical use cases, being both extensions of the above E2E example, as well as more topical use cases, i.e. focused on the model risk analytics side (instead of learning how to create a basic instance).
