# Automation procedures

The user can create an [Automation](../concepts/glossary.md#automation) that executes an instance at a set time or with a recurrence.

## Creating an Automation from within the menu

1. Access the Automations menu and click on 'new'.

4. Automation should have a name and a description.

You are then taken to the detail view for automation. Here is also where you see the history of the tasks.

You can also see the definition of the task and you can navigate to the instance it is related to.

The display is either a list or a card view. You can see the status of each task that was ran as well as the session that was generated by the task.
A task is successful if it starts and finishes. The task status does not depend on the status of the execution of the session.

A task can be in failed state if the instance gets deleted and the task should run it.
